SiteCapture
===========

SiteCapture is free and open source website screen capturing application developed in C#.

Anyone who needs to create a bitmap image of a website will find SiteCapture useful, however, I developed it with web developers, bloggers and online marketers in mind. Each URL captured is saved with the browser and image dimensions to easily recapture the image with a single click.
